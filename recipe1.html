      <h1>Recipe 1: Tomato Soup</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I choose to make tomato soup for my first cooking experience I really enjoyed making this recipe and it ended up being pretty simple and tasted very good. The instructions were easy to follow and it was helpful because my sister helped me cook this recipe so it was nice working with someone else.</p>
      <h2>My Rating of this Recipe: 7/10</h2>
      <p>I think this was a good starting point and helped me pratice with mutlitasking because while you have the tomatos cooking in the oven you are working with the other ingredients at the same time.</p>

    <p><b>Personal Insights:</b>
      <p>Following this reference recipe I did a few things differently, firstly for ingredients I used 6 medium sized tomatoes, along with about half a pack of cherry tomatos, used minced garlic instead of fresh garlic cloves, and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I also didn't follow the exact measurements for certain parts such as, I didn't measure the olive oil or spices exactly, and just put them right in. I also instead put the tomatos in the oven for 20 minutes insted of 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>For the rest I followed the recipe and I defiennty plan to make this again especially during the winter!</p>
      <p>While making this recipe I would recommend following the step that mentions either blending or using a mixer for this recipe because while making this recipe my mom and I were really hungry and I decided to skip this step and the soup ended by very chunky but still very good but definitely follow this step for a smoother texture.</p>
